# Object-Tracking-with-YOLOv8-and-YOLO11
Senior Capstone Project: Comparing YOLOv8s and YOLO11s when applied to real-time object tracking scenarios on a moving platform.

Abstract: Object detection has long been a complicated problem in computer vision, and has only recently rapidly improved thanks to the creation of deep learning algorithms. YOLO is one such algorithm which creates bounding boxes over objects it is trained to identify. There have been many different versions of the YOLO algorithm over the past decade, from YOLOv2 to YOLOv26. This project aims to compare how the YOLOv8s and YOLO11s algorithms differ in efficiency when applied to a non-stationary robot using picture-based object tracking software when following a moving target. The vehicular robot, called Follower, runs Python on a Raspberry Pi 4 and used a small fixed camera to capture images. Those images are wirelessly sent to a nearby computer and processed with a YOLO model. Instructions are sent back to Follower so that it may find and track the target.
